# OAuth Explainer

I had a good time learning about oAuth in my [Workdaybot Slack Project](https://github.com/juniorbird/workdaybot). In fact, the main thing I learned about in that project was how to make oAuth work! So I whipped up this explainer so that I could share what I learned.

## Technologies

I built this in SVG, because why not? It was a great exercise to learn all about drawing with Canvas.

## Keys & Security

I show real keys in this example, because I personally find it more useful to see things that look real than something like {SECRET_HERE}. The keys shown have been deactivated.
